# 2D Game Engine

A tile based 2D game engine written in C++ with Lua and using the SDL Library.

# TODO
1. Make dependent components require each other, ie Entities with sprite component must have a transform component. Could be a warning or Auto Add.
2. Move velocity from transform to a Physics component.
3. Add bounding box renderer to collision component.
